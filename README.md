Twitter Sentiment Analysis:
Overview
This Python code performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning. The provided datasets, twitter_training.csv and twitter_validation.csv, serve as the training and validation sets, respectively. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set to predict sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) for tweets.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (install using pip install -r requirements.txt):
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
other dependencies...# NLP_Project

File Structure:
data/: Directory containing the training and validation datasets.
twitter_training.csv: Training dataset.
twitter_validation.csv: Validation dataset.
models/: Directory to save trained models.
src/: Source code directory.
preprocess_data.py: Module for data preprocessing.
train_model.py: Script to train the sentiment analysis model.
evaluate_model.py: Script to evaluate the trained model.
sentiment_model.py: Module containing the sentiment analysis model.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.

Notes:
Customize the model hyperparameters in sentiment_model.py.
Fine-tune the preprocessing steps in preprocess_data.py if needed.
Feel free to experiment with different machine learning models or algorithms.
